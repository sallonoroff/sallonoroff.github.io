	<p>The dollops of poorly-written text you'll find on this weblog are based on thoughts originally formulated inside the head of Mark Wainwright. Let's pretend that the best stuff is lost in translation.</p>
	<p>Mark is an incapable perfectionist with inclinations toward idleness, over-eating, pedantry and self-deprecating humour. And clearly he's the sort of idiot that thinks somebody might care what he has to say about computers, science, technology, the web and lots of other stuff.</p>
	<p>This site is made with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. There's nothing particularly special about the code behind all this &mdash; most of it is borrowed from elsewhere anyway &mdash; but if you'd like a peek head over <a href="https://github.com/sallonoroff/sallonoroff.github.io/">here</a>.</p>
	<p>In the unlikely event that you should want or need to get in touch, please email <a href="mailto:mail@sallonoroff.co.uk">mail@sallonoroff.co.uk</a> or tweet something <a href="http://twitter.com/sallonoroff">@sallonoroff</a>.</p>
	<p>Sadly there are no prizes for reading this far.</p>
